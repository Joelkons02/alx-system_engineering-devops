# Journey through Cyber Savannah: Unmasking the Rhythm of the Digital Dance in Cameroon

Jambo! üåç Welcome to a remarkable journey through the vibrant cyber savannah of Cameroon. Imagine sipping kola nut-infused coffee ‚òï as you soak in the sun's warmth, when suddenly, your web app takes an unexpected detour to groove to its own rhythm. Get ready to explore the cyber safari of "Mbom Dances"...

## Mbom Dances and Digital Disruption

**Duration:** August 10, 2023, 8:00 AM - August 10, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)  
**Impact:** A lively web application outage swept in, causing rhythmic slowdowns and intermittent pauses, affecting around 20% of our cherished users.

## Source of the Beat: Ndop Drums

The incident's unique dance was orchestrated by an unforeseen guest - a marketing campaign with the sway of a Cameroonian Ndop dance. The sudden surge of users led to a digital dance floor overload, resulting in a momentary halt in the rhythms of the app.

## Rhythmic Timeline: Makossa Moves

- **08:00 AM:** The drums sounded as alerts drummed up high server response time warnings.
- **08:15 AM:** Our dance troupe (engineers) noticed increased missteps (errors) and whispers of sluggish beats from users.
- **08:30 AM:** Initial dance-floor inspection focused on server resources and network beats.
- **09:00 AM:** We assumed the dance floor grooves suffered due to server capacity struggles from the unexpected crowd.
- **09:30 AM:** Additional dancers (server instances) joined the ensemble, but the syncopated dance continued.
- **10:00 AM:** We called in the Ndop dance masters (Database Ops) for intricate dance interpretations.
- **10:30 AM:** An unexpected twist unveiled high database query delays and strained connections.
- **11:00 AM:** The dance moves were polished (query optimization), and the dance circle expanded (database connection pool).
- **11:30 AM:** The rhythm gradually harmonized, and user reports of lagging beats subsided.

## Misleading Choreography: Dances in Disguise

- We initially focused on the dance floor's size (server capacity), neglecting the rhythm section's contribution (database).
- Attempted an energetic entrance by amplifying dancers (server instances), but the true dance groove remained elusive.
- We suspected an unexpected dance break (DDoS attack), but our investigations didn't find definitive proof.

## Star-studded Performance: Cameroon's Dance Troop Takes Center Stage

We invited the Database Maestros to lead a mesmerizing performance:

- Identified the secret soloist: database query delays.
- Enhanced sluggish steps with optimized queries and an expanded dance circle (database connection pool).
- Fine-tuned the rhythm pattern with caching adjustments for future dance sequences.
- The spotlight returned as the database guided the dance, and our application regained its mesmerizing rhythm.

## The Heart of the Dance and Harmonious Resolution

The heart of the dance was revealed: a surge in database query delays due to the unexpected influx. We turned the dance around by optimizing queries, elevating the database connection pool, and fine-tuning caching. The crowd cheered as our application regained its harmonious dance, delivering an electrifying performance.

## Dance Rejuvenation and Preventative Measures

**Dance Improvements:**

- Craft a VIP dance routine (automated scaling) to match the rhythm of unusual traffic surges.
- Strengthen dance floor monitoring and drum up alerts for database rhythm metrics.
- Create a dance circle of seamless communication for cross-team collaboration during dance-offs.

**Choreography Tasks:**

1. Choreograph and implement automated scaling sequences based on rhythmic traffic patterns.
2. Choreograph and orchestrate advanced database monitoring routines and dashboards.
3. Review dance strategies (caching) thoroughly to ensure harmonious resource utilization.
4. Host dance rehearsal sessions (incident response training) for our esteemed dance ensembles in engineering and operations.

## Final Flourish: Uniting Cameroon's Cyber Dance

This digital dance extravaganza underscored the paramount importance of proactive rhythm monitoring, swift dance-floor responses, and unified cross-team dance ensembles. By identifying the heart of the dance, enhancing database performance, and infusing automated rhythm adjustments, we recaptured our application's harmonious dance and minimized the impact on our cherished dancers (users). Moving forward, the lessons learned from this dance will lead our rhythmic strides in strengthening our dance stage (infrastructure), refining our dance moves (response strategies), and ensuring an even more splendid and harmonious dance experience for all.
